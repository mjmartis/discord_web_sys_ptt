This Chrome extension allows the Discord web client "push to talk" (PTT) mode
to operate from any tab in the browser (or system-wide). When cued with its own
shortcut key combo, the extension emulates PTT keydown / keyup events in the
Discord tab that is broadcasting voice.

To operate:
  1) Install the extension in Chrome.

  2) Set the extension shortcut (in chrome://extensions/shortcuts) to your
     prefered PTT key combo. If you are not using Chrome OS, you may also set
     the shortcut to global to use it outside of a Chrome tab.

  3) Reload your Discord web client tab, and enable PTT mode. You must specify
     some PTT key combo in your Discord web settings, but the particular combo
     specified is not used and does not matter.

Known issues:
  - PTT can sometimes "bounce" on and off when using the extension. This is a
    side-effect of Chrome's extension shortcut architecture (in which a
    "shortcut pressed" event is provided instead of a "shortcut down/up" event
    pair). Some amount of bouncing appears unavoidable.
